I would to have the following NFT collection added:

- Name: <Like ERC-721 Metadata Name, example: "Ethereum Name Service">
- Symbol: <Like ERC-721 Metadata Symbol, example: "ENS">
- Address: <Checksum address where a ERC-721 or ERC-1155 is deployed on specific chain with ChainId.>
- ChainId: <ChainId according to https://chainlist.org/, example: "1" for Ethereum>
- LogoURI: <A Link to a logo that represents the NFT collection, a small & simple SVG is preferred otherwise a PNG.>
- Override: <default is "false", when name & symbol should override what is provided by the contract itself then "true">
